Welcome! I'm Zheng Xu, a Ph.D. candidate at the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I study algebraic geometry under the supervision of Professor Wenhao Ou.
My research focuses on birational geometry in positive characteristics. Here is my [[https://ErenJeager.github.io/files/cv.pdf]](https://github.com/ZhengXumath/ErenJeager.github.io/blob/master/cv.pdf)" CV.

Abstract. In this paper, we prove the abundance conjecture for threefolds over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p > 3$ in the case of numerical dimension equals to $2$. More  precisely, we prove that if $(X,B)$ be a projective lc threefold pair over $k$ such that $K_{X}+B$ is nef and $\nu(K_{X}+B)=2$, then $K_{X}+B$ is semiample.

Abstract. In this paper, we prove the non-vanishing and some special cases of the log abundance for lc threefold pairs over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p > 3$. More  precisely, we prove that if $(X,B)$ be a projective lc threefold pair over $k$ and $K_{X}+B$ is pseudo-effective, then $\kappa(K_{X}+B)\geq 0$, and if $K_{X}+B$ is nef and $\kappa(K_{X}+B)\geq 1$, then $K_{X}+B$ is semiample. 

As applications, we show that the log canonical rings of projective lc threefold pairs over $k$ are finitely generated, and the log abundance holds when the nef dimension $n(K_{X}+B)\leq 2$ or when the Albanese map  $a_{X}:X\to \mathrm{Alb}(X)$ is non-trivial. Moreover, we prove that the log abundance for klt threefold pairs over $k$ implies the log abundance for lc threefold pairs over $k$.
