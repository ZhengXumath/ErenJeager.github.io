Welcome! My name is Zheng Xu and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I study algebraic geometry under the supervision of Wenhao Ou.
My research focuses on birational geometry in positive characteristics and I'm interested in algebraic geometry in mixed characteristics and Hodge theory as well.
